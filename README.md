# hello-world
Yes, I am doing the Github tutorial that comes with starting a GitHub account. Judge me as you see fit. 

Now, I'm making changes to my README document. I wonder if anybody including myself will ever read this again. I've been on this coding journey for yay these last six months - so far, so good. 

Update 1/27/18: 
Here I am again. 
Still trying to learn how github works.

This looks like it's going to me my first branch.
